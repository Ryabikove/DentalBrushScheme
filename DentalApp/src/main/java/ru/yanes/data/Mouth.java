/**
 * A class representing a model of the oral cavity: contains all the teeth and the spaces between them.
 * <p>
 * The teeth are stored in the {@link #teeth} array and are ordered according to the order
 * of the dental schema (upper jaw from left to right, then lower jaw from right to left).
 * The spaces are stored in the {@link #spaces} array; each space connects two adjacent teeth.
 * <p>
 * The numbering of the spaces has a peculiarity: there is no space between the last tooth of the upper jaw (18) and the first
 * tooth of the lower jaw (48), so the space indices are offset for the lower jaw. The {@code spaces} array has a length of {@code teeth.length - 2} (30),
 * since there are 32 teeth in total, and there is one less space for each jaw (16 teeth → 15 spaces).
 * <p>
 * Lombok's {@code @Getter} annotation automatically generates getters for the {@link #teeth} and {@link #spaces} fields.
